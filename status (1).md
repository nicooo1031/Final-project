Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have mainly worked on the script and characters that I want to involve. I've also decided to personality type questions amongst the game to direct the player to different endings instead of doing minigames. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't decided what type of questions I want to ask and formatting the code. I have brainstormed and planed to use a lot of for loops in my game. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I want to do a vidual novel but I'm confused on what type of formatting I want to use for my for loop tree.
