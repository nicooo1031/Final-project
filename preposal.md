# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to create either a horror visual novel or a stardew valley mod. For the visual novel, I would like to do something in the psycological horror genre and would like to include atleast 2 minigames into the actual visual novel. With the mini games, I plan on making 3 endings (based on the results of the minigame). If this does not work, I would like to create a stardew valley mod which tells you the likes, dislikes, favorites, and most hated objects for each character in the game. Ideally, I would do it in a way where it can be accessed in the hearts-tracking menu of the game, or if you click a button while speaking with the character/hovering over the character. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to do the project alone. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?
